# Requirements
We have a careers page at http://lonelyplanet.com/careers.

The jobs data comes from a JSON endpoint.

The goal of this test is to create a single page app that does the following:

1. Utilize the data from `http://app.recruiterbox.com/widget/12766/openings/` to list out the jobs that are available
2. Use the content from the current careers site to fill in the TODO's 
3. Add a "become a contributer" page, that uses content from existing page

# Install
